In this project I used differnt files and functions to draw my initals using the input.txt file.

I used a make file to combine the files together for easier use to compile files.

When running program without input.txt you can create lines using a certain amount where you want a point P then the plot on the graph.
For a vertical line V with the plot on the graph and the amount of points in a vertical line you want.
For a horizontal line H with the plot on the graph and the amount of points in a horizontal line you want.
